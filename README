This is your new Play 2.1 application
=====================================

This file will be packaged with your application, when using `play dist`.

=====================================

Example code for transloadit integration.
See disclaimer below.

It is expected that the user has a basic understanding of how transloadit works
and has created a API key and secret. A template is used in the example code.
The secure signing must also be enabled in your transloadit account settings.

This is an example Application for integrating with the very nice transloadit
service.

The application is a standard Play 2.1 application with two routes added and 
two html templates; one for each route.

One route (GET /upload) is to display an upload form that can be used to 
generate and send a signed upload request to transload it.

The other route (POST /install) is used to receive the processing metadata 
returned by the transloadit service.

The template upload.scala.html contains the basic upload form.
The template install.scala.html displays the data received from transloadit.

Sign.java is used to generate the HmacSha1 signature. 

Application.java contains the relevant methods for generating the signature
and handling the routes specified above.

A node.js implementation is included to easily compare the generated signatures 
of the data between the node and java versions.
See: TransloaditAuthRequest.js 
Run: node TransloaditAuthRequest.js

A simple unit test for the Sign class is included in ApplicationTest.java.
Running "play test" will execute the hmac test method, this test will output 
the same value as running the node.js version: node TransloaditAuthRequest.js.
